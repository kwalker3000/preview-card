## My process:

Actually did the project twice. First time was a learning curve with trial and error. Had some ideas but not enough experience
with those ideas. Second time around was more methodical knowing what does and does not work. Starting with the mobile design
and working top to bottom. Then building off it to create desktop layout. I doubt the code is efficient, but that is something
I can improve on.

### Built with:

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned:

- Be more systematic in approach 
- Set one element at a time and build off of that 
- Have certain properties, like font, set before positioning
- ways to improve my README files

### Continued development:

- positioning (think I lost track of what my margins were actually doing)
- work faster
- be more efficient with my css
- continue learning responsive design and how to incorporate it in my projects
